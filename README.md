**ML for E3SM MAM aerosol microphysics: Data Extraction, Visualization & Training**

A small toolkit for building ML models from E3SM outputs. It has two main capabilities:
- Generate training/validation/testing datasets directly from the model raw outputs and optionally plot 2D histograms for quick distribution checks.
- Train and evaluate neural networks on those datasets, saving the best model, learning curves, and a biasâ€“variance table.
